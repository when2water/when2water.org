			We are Harshal Sheth &amp; Nihar Sheth, two high school students from Westford, MA. We love to experiment and build things.
			After seeing all the water that is wasted by modern sprinkler controllers, we decided to create an alternative which would save water, without damaging the lawn.
			We pull past, present, and future weather data from the NOAA to provide you with accurate signals about which days to water on and which days to not - saving you money and water
			without damaging your lawn. 
			Our watering decisions are made using an <a href="http://goo.gl/POnmnG" target="_blank">advanced machine learning algorithm</a> which we submitted to the prestigious <a href="https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/" target="_blank">Google Science Fair</a>. Our project was selected as one of 31 worldwide local award winners.
			After a year of work, we released our invention to the world and when2water was born - dedicated to helping both the environment and your pocketbook!
